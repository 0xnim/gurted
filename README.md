TODO:
1. Write a new **selection system**. Godot's built-in `RichTextLabel` selection is limited by the node's boundaries. In normal web, holding click and dragging your mouse across the screen will select text across multiple nodes. Godot doesn't have a "set_selected_text" property, despite having one for "get_selected_text".
2. **Right-click Dropdown** for basic text operations (Copy, Paste, Cut). Download options for images
3. **Select-all CTRL+A shortcut**
4. **Scrolling** in the website container
5. **Store** tab containers so switching tabs won't erase previous tab.
6. **GIF** support
